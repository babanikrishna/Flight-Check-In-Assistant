### Design Patterns

**Component Architecture**: The application follows a feature-based architecture where components are organized by functionality rather than type, promoting maintainability and clear separation of concerns.

**State Management**: Custom React hooks inspired by SwiftUI patterns provide clean state management without the complexity of external state management libraries like Redux.

**Type-Driven Development**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety throughout the application, preventing runtime errors and improving development experience.

## Core Features

### Email Parsing Engine

The heart of the application is a sophisticated email parsing system that can extract structured flight information from unstructured text. The parsing engine uses carefully crafted regular expressions to identify and extract:

- Flight numbers and airline codes
- Passenger names and confirmation codes  
- Departure and arrival airport codes
- Flight dates and times in various formats
- Gate, terminal, and seat assignment information

The system has been tested with email formats from over 10 major airlines and includes comprehensive error handling to provide meaningful feedback when parsing fails or when required information is missing.

### 3D Globe Visualization

Flight routes are rendered on an interactive 3D Earth model that provides several key features:

**Automatic Camera Positioning**: The globe intelligently positions the camera to optimally view flight routes, calculating the best altitude and angle based on the distance between airports.

**Interactive Elements**: Users can click on airports and flight routes to access detailed information, with smooth camera transitions that focus on selected elements.

**Visual Feedback**: Departure airports are marked in green while arrival airports appear in blue, with animated flight paths that help users understand their travel routes at a glance.

**Touch and Mouse Support**: The globe supports both mouse and touch interactions, making it fully functional on desktop and mobile devices.

### Flight Data Management

**Persistent Storage**: Flight information is stored locally in the browser, ensuring privacy while providing persistent access to flight history across sessions.

**Duplicate Prevention**: The system intelligently prevents duplicate entries by comparing flight numbers and dates before adding new flights to the history.

**Geographic Calculations**: Using the Haversine formula, the application calculates accurate great-circle distances between airports and provides estimated flight durations.

### Calendar Integration

**Google Calendar Integration**: Users can add flight information directly to Google Calendar with pre-populated event details including passenger information, confirmation codes, and airport details.

**Universal Calendar Support**: The application generates standard .ics calendar files that work with all major calendar applications including Apple Calendar, Outlook, and others.

**Smart Reminders**: Calendar events are automatically configured with check-in reminders set for 2 hours before departure time.
